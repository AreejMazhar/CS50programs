            <div class = "content-box">
                <p class = "content">Arts encompass a diverse range of creative expressions, including visual arts, performing arts, literature, music and more. I, personally, am a sketcher and a painter. I mostly use watercolors and acrylic paints, though prefer color pencils and markers. I started out with an anime type drawing style as I am a fan of that form of entertainment, but I have been trying to develop my own style and learn anatomy to improve my skills. Arts help me design my own characters and help me better visualize them. To see some of my works, check the <a href="/gallery">Gallery!</a></p>

            <p class = "subject"> Crafts </p>
            <div class = "content-box">
                <p class = "content">Handmade crafts embody a sense of artistry, skill and authenticity that is often lacking in mass-produced items. I have a love for such crafts as it shows how someone poured out their time, effort and care into a single hand-made item. I recently have tried my hand at making custom birthday cards and keychains for my friends and family, as well as bookmarks for the bookworms in the family. It’s always a joy making such things, and I look forward to branching out and trying to make more things. To see some of my works, check the <a href="/gallery">Gallery!</a></p>

            <p class = "subject"> Gaming </p>
            <div class = "content-box">
                <p class = "content">Gaming has gained significant popularity in recent years and caters to almost all age groups. It’s accessible as all types of games are available on different platforms such as consoles, computers or mobile devices. Gaming allows people like me to immerse themselves in virtual worlds, engage in challenges and connect with others who share similar interests. I personally do play the occasional competitive game like Valorant or League of Legends, but I am more of a fan of MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) such as Genshin Impact which allows me to explore and enjoy a good story with amazing visuals. Though I will play anything if I enjoy it, I am not very picky.</p>

        <div class = "bg4">
            <p class = "subject"> Reading </p>
            <div class = "content-box">
                <p class = "content">Reading is not just a hobby but also a means of intellectual growth and personal enrichment. It provides individuals like me with the opportunity to expand their knowledge and engage with new ideas, perspectives and cultures. I’m a huge fan of Greek and Roman mythology, so books like the Percy Jackson series were very fun to read. Otherwise, I’m a sucker for soft romances and cliché tropes like rivals to lovers, childhood best friends, roommates, etc. I do, however, enjoy the occasional fantasy elements as well as action and horror/thriller-based novels as well!</p>

        <div class = "bg5">
            <p class = "subject"> Writing </p>
            <div class = "content-box">
                <p class = "content">Writing allows me to express my thoughts, emotions and creativity in written form. My mind is always bustling with new ideas, thoughts and scenarios, so writing can serve as a therapeutic outlet and help me explore my ideas more in depth. As I mentioned in the Art section, I have many of my own characters. Writing helps me explore their back stories, their interactions with one other, their personalities and so much more. Writing allows me to build whole worlds and universes with their own rules. It really is just another form of art. </p>

            <p class = "subject"> Baking </p>
            <div class = "content-box">
                <p class = "content">Baking, as a hobby, involves the systematic and precise process of creating delicious treats through the art of combining ingredients and following recipes. It requires a keen attention to detail, as even the smallest deviation in measurements or techniques can greatly affect the outcome of baked goods. I am taking this hobby slow, having already baked brownies, cakes and cupcakes, and helped my mom with baking pizza. Baking can be quite costly, and our oven is old and difficult to work with, but having delicious treats in the end is always worth it!</p>

        <div class = "bg7">
            <p class = "subject"> Crochet </p>
            <div class = "content-box">
                <p class = "content">Crochet is a popular hobby that involves creating items using yarn and a crochet hook. These items can range from clothing attire, to blankets and quilts, to even stuffed toys. I have always wanted to try it myself but have never found the courage to try it as crochet uses various stiches and techniques to manipulate the yarn. It can seem scary for beginners, but I will try to at least make a small thing out of it soon. A coaster seems like a good place to start!</p>

            <div class = "content-box">
                <p class = "content">Quilling paper, also known as paper filigree, is a unique and intricate hobby that involves creating decorative designs using strips of paper. You must meticulously roll, shape, and glue strips of paper into various shapes such as coils, scrolls and teardrops. Something like this can be very time-consuming and requires a lot of patience, but the results are often so beautiful. I have a quilling set ready so I will start it out with something simple like a flower.</p>
