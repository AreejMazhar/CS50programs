Certain genres would have certain values of energy, valence and danceability. For example, sadder songs would have a lower valence, energy and danceability while Pop or rock/metal songs would have much higher values.
Artisits also usually stick to one or two genres, so taking that into consideration, a person's 'audio aura' could be based on what artists they listen to, and what genres the artists usually follow.

Though of course, just this would not always give an accurate reprensentation of the listener. The top 100 songs could be of personal favourite interest, a mix of many artists and genres and overall give an inaccurate assumption.
Instead, maybe the 'Audio Aura' should be based on the Top songs from a certain genre or genres that the listener most often listens from. Genres usually have specific energy, valence and danceability and might provide a more accurate result.
